The CryptoTradingFramework library allows you to create custom applications for cryptocurrency exchanges, supporting the following features:

The `CryptoMarketClient` Avalonia application supports both manual trading and automated trading bot operations with various strategies. It features classic arbitrage monitoring, statistical arbitrage monitoring, and supports multiple trading strategies.

The `CryptoMarketClient` app utilizes the [EMX Controls library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Eremex.Avalonia.Controls) for Avalonia to build its UI. The application makes extensive use of these EMX components:
- DataGridControl — Displays data from an item source as a table. Supports built-in data sorting, grouping, filtering, searching, and editing functionality.
- CartesianChart — Allows you to plot most popular charts: Candlestick, Line, Bar, Range Bar, and more.
- DockManager — Allows you to build and manage Microsoft Visual Studio-inspired docking interfaces.
